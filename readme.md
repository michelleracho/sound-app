    > Patatap is a visual sound kit application with animations by computer programmer Jono Brandel and Japanese electronic duo Lullatone, consisting of Shawn James Seymour and Yoshimi Tomida.

    > Patatap consists of unique palettes of colors, sounds, and shapes that are altered via the spacebar. The 26 melodic and rhythmic sounds that are in each set are triggered by pressing the A to Z keys. All of the sounds present a visual animation over the background when played.
